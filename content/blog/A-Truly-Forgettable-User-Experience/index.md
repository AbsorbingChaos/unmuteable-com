Forgetting passwords is a commonplace mistake, and one we are often trained to work around. If you click the "forgot my password" link, enter some info, maybe answer some questions, then a few minutes later you're typically good to go.

With crypto and keys, this is quite different. Your seed phrase, which is directly related to your private key, needs to be protected at all costs. **There is no way to recover it.**

This can be a scary thought, but I appreciate the way Blockstack is implementing [Blockstack Connect](https://docs.blockstack.org/authentication/connect), and I do believe public/private key pairs are the answer to website logins and their underlying security.
