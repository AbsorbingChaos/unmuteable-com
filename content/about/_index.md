# This publication represents the Unmuteable

> A community voice that speaks truth and will not be silenced.

Unmuteable. This is a publication centered around crypto, privacy, and decentralization. The name is a play on the immutability of a blockchain, with core values based on ethics, honesty, and integrity. It is designed to be a collection of voices from the community and beyond, focused on the impact of blockchain, decentralization, and crypto on society and culture as a whole.

Unmutable aims to build a community around these core values, and supports the creation and enforcement of a "Can't Be Evil" code of conduct inspired by the Stacks ecosystem. In order to change the predatory practices in place on today's Internet, we must all take a stand together to define what Web 3.0 really should be.

We want to give people a space to be open and raw while documenting the rise of the user-owned Internet. We want to tackle the challenges of our journey to decentralization as a publication, and both educate and learn alongside the community.

## Let's talk about it

Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are a complex subject, but to some, they enable a technical revolution whose value is underrealized, underutilized, and somewhat undefined in terms of potential.

With varying consensus mechanisms, protocols, and communities, it can be hard to know where to focus your attention, and the concepts often ramp up from simple to complex in a heartbeat.

## Defining the voice

We like to tackle hard subjects, share real opinions, and teach as we learn together.

We like to promote good people, interesting projects, and products or services that we would use ourselves.

## New horizons

It all started with the Stacks ecosystem in January of 2020.

As they ramped up to complete the infrastructure for the Stacks 2.0 blockchain, new technologies, opportunities, and concepts emerged, including the implementation of a new consensus mechanism that brings promising new functionality to the world's most secure blockchain: Bitcoin.

Fast-forward and there are now [several apps running on Stacks](https://app.co), a friendly and vibrant [community on Discord](https://community.blockstack.org/discord), and several new projects and ideas forming in anticipation of [the mainnet launch](http://whenmainnet.co), including the [Stacks Foundation](https://stacks.org), [Daemon Technologies](http://daemontechnologies.co/), [Freehold](https://joinfreehold.com), and [New Internet Labs](https://newinternetlabs.com).

In short, good things are coming *very soon!*
