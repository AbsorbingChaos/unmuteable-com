# This publication represents **The Unmuteable**.

## A community voice that speaks truth and will not be silenced.

### Let's talk about it

Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are a complex subject, but to some, they enable a technical revolution whose value is underrealized, underutilized, and somewhat undefined in terms of potential.

With varying consensus mechanisms, protocols, and communities, it can be hard to know where to focus your attention, and the concepts often ramp up from simple to complex in a heartbeat.

### Having a voice

We like to tackle hard subjects, share real opinions, and teach as we learn together.

We like to promote good people, interesting projects, and products that we would use ourselves.

It all started with Blockstack in January of 2020. As they ramped up to complete the infrastructure for the Stacks 2.0 blockchain, new technologies, opportunities, and concepts began emerging, creating a new consensus mechanism and bringing new functionality to the world's most secure blockchain: Bitcoin.

### New horizons

Fast-forward and there are now [several apps running on Stacks](https://app.co), a friendly and vibrant [community on Discord](https://community.blockstack.org/discord), and several new projects and ideas forming in anticipation of [the mainnet launch](http://whenmainnet.co), including the [Stacks Foundation](https://stacks.org), [Daemon Technologies](http://daemontechnologies.co/), [Freehold](https://joinfreehold.com), and [New Internet Labs](https://newinternetlabs.com).

In short, good things are coming *very soon!*
